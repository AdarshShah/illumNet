# illumNet
A Deep Learning Based Approach to Image Enhancement

Based on Sparsely Stacked Denoising Auto-encoders, layers of VGG16 and HSV image represetation. Major improvements are high color retention and high structural similarity index with respect to LLnet. 

The main.ipynb and dataset is in Kaggle. 

# To Handle
Square Artifacts : can be handled using bilinear interpolation. Will be implemented later.

This work is in continuation to Retinex Algorithms, classical approach to image enhancement.
